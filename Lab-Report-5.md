I would like to talk about Lab Report 4 since it's the only one I've completed.
Since I fell behind around midterms time, I had no clue how to do this task when it was assigned and didn't complete it back in week 7.
I only really got any real grasp on what to do and how to do it in this task after using tutoring to develop my autograder, but still had to get immense help from tutoring and friends in order to complete it fully.
One thing I wonder is if there's a better and faster way to navigate the file in nano (ListExamples.java) then using the arrow keys.
Doing that lab report, I wondered in my head if it was really efficient to be using the arrow keys one at a time for all my navigation. It also made me wonder how the hell something like that would be done in a bash script and if it would use nano at all.
That's something that I would like to explore and would change about how I did this lab if I had time to go back.
